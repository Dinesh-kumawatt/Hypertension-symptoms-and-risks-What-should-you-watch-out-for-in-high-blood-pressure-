Hypertension, commonly called high blood pressure, is a condition where the force of the blood against artery walls is consistently too high. It often develops slowly and can go unnoticed for years, earning it the title "silent killer." Early symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, nosebleeds, and blurry vision. If left unmanaged, hypertension can lead to severe health issues such as heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, and vision loss. Regular monitoring is key, especially for individuals over 40, those with a family history, obesity, or a sedentary lifestyle. It's important to act early by adopting healthy habits, reducing salt intake, managing stress, and seeking medical guidance.
